### Admin Panel
The **system administrator** has such functions as editing his own data (email and password), adding students (.csv file), and adding a person from hr.

- Adding students by the administrator is done by sending a `.csv` file. The file must contain such keys as:

| Key               | Description                                                                           | Validate                          |

### HR Panel
The **HR panel** helps a person from companies to find suitable candidates for work, conduct interviews with them and propose cooperation. The user of this panel can also edit his account.

- **Available students** - tab in which a person from hr can view job candidates added by the administrator, and can also add them to the "For interview" tab. It is possible to filter students and to search for them by name.

- **Interview students** - A tab where a person from hr can view the candidates he added himself. There is a limit imposed by the administrator as to the number of students who can be in this tab. It is possible to filter students, as well as search for them by name, as well as buttons that lead to the candidate's CV, removal from the "For interview" tab, and employment of a candidate. When hr clicks on the last option, the student's account will cease to be active.

### Student Panel
The **student's panel** is a place where a user invited by the administrator and a job seeker can edit their account by supplementing the relevant information that will be displayed by the person from hr. The user of this panel can also mark himself as employed and his account will cease to be active at that moment.
